# What is this?
I'm Jess Dale and this is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it - as well as provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and what I expect from you.

If I've missed something here, or if you feel like there's a mismatch in what you've read versus what you've seen from me, please raise it. This is public with the intent that it will make it easier for you to hold me accountable!

> Disclaimer:
> This document does not apply to anyone else in the company, and solely reflects on my personal management style.

# My role
As a Design Manager, it is my job to:

1. Start with why - providing context and vision
2. Manage and develop well-functioning design teams
3. Create safe spaces and provide support for designers to develop and growth
4. Refine or define processes that ensure the success of our team's work
5. Hire, train and retain world-class talent

I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.

If I fail at any of these - especially anything that puts retaining you at risk - you would be doing me a **huge** favor by letting me know as soon as possible. I don't expect everyone to stick around forever, however if a departure is potentially due to something we could have done different, I would appreciate the chance to make things right first.

# My values and approach
I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked on the product side, the agency side, and the consultant side and each come with their own sets of challenges. At the end of the day, these are my values as a manager:

* I value being human and showing empathy. 
* I value transparency and honesty and integrity.
* I value pushing for improvement and being accountable.
* I value acknowledging mistakes and creating safe spaces.

My teams come first, the clients second, and the company comes third. Obviously I have a responsibility to the company, but without a well operating, well staffed, and well functioning team, I am unable to live up to those responsibilities. Your success is ultimately my success - so I will go out of my way to try and make you successful.

# What I expect from folks who report to me
I am not an authoritarian boss. I do not want to micro manage anyone - it's not a good use of my time, or yours.

I expect you to operate as a [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4). 

I am not here to tell you how to do your job. I believe you are able to operate as a professional adult, and make smart decisions. This does not mean that I expect you to do everything on your own. I will be here to provide you guidance and mentorship (either through me, or by finding the people you should be getting it from). Nor do I expect you to know everything - when you need help, I expect you to not hesitate and ask for it. If you feel you made a mistake, own up to it, we're all human and mistakes happen. 

Ultimately, I am here to help you do your job in any way I can and to help you evaluate your approach.

I am also a strong proponent of setting healthy goals and boundaries for yourself, and I feel it's my responsibility to model healthy work-life balance. Please ask me more about this!

Please invest in yourself and focus on self-improvement. This looks different for everyone and can be going deeper, going broader, or engaging in feedback to really listen. If you’re a manager, please build a peer network for yourself and keep learning and educating yourself about leadership.

# What you can expect from me as a manager
I'm a big fan of 1-on-1s. I believe that these meetings are for you to set the agenda. Come ready with some topics or anything that's on your mind. What’s going well? What’s bugging you? These don’t need to be about work updates unless you really want to talk about work. If there are things that I want to ask you, I’ll do it, but this is your time. If I have feedback, I will also provide it during this time. 

I will also bring some standard questions for us talk through:

* "Anything else on your mind?" - Just in case you forgot something!
* "What can I do support you?" - Am I blocking you on anything? Do you have any additional requests?
* "Any advice for me?" - This is me opening the conversation to receive feedback from you - please provide it if you have it!

## Feedback
I am a strong believer of [Radical Candor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIh_992Nfes); I want to ensure that you are receiving honest and actionable feedback on a consistent basis. There should never be a scenario where a performance review, or in the worst case scenario, a Performance Improvement Plan, is the first time that you hear negative comments or feedback. I will provide you with feedback and guidance to the best of my ability, and will do my best to ensure that you understand the feedback that I provide to you. I will always ensure that feedback is given in a private setting.

Feedback should go both ways. I am relying on you to let me know when I am doing something detrimental to my position, our relationship, or the company. If at any point you feel you have feedback to provide to me, I will listen and internalize the feedback you give me.

I will also send an anonymous feedback form on occassion to allow anyone to provide feedback they do not feel comfortable telling me in person.

I will provide feedback on how you're doing during our 1-on-1s. If there's something I'm worried about, I will let you know. If you worry that I may be worried about your performance, please let me know. Let's talk about it. It's tough to resolve any issues or concerns if we're not having open conversation. 

## Communication
In general, please over-communicate with me. Don’t worry about sending me too many messages or overwhelming me, it’s really valuable, and in our remote context, I’d love to be here for you for what comes up because I can’t see how you’re doing by walking around an office.

### Meetings and schedule
While I have a preference to meeting for 30 minutes every week, the length, frequency, and medium are up to you. To start, I will book us time to meet for 1 hour once a week. As mentioned before, this is not the only time you can reach me - if there is ever something on your mind, please reach out. If I am busy, I will find time for you.

# My personality and quirks
* I am an [Internal Thinker](https://coachapproachministries.org/thinking-styles/). I will take my time to purposefully choose the words
that I am going to use. I will take my time to rationalize a situation to ensure that I fully grasp what I am commenting on/contributing
to. I am not loud. I have been told that this sometimes feels like I am not engaged or interested in participating (especially in larger
discussions) - but often it means that I am trying to internalize everything before I add my 2 cents. Feel free to call me out if you want
to hear from me.
* I am traditionally a [People Pleaser](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shrink/201210/are-you-people-pleaser). This has acted as a
detriment to me in the past due to taking on too much work when I feasibly could not do this. While I have grown away from this mentality,
I still want to find a way to help everyone. I try my best to not let this impact my ability to do my job, and more importantly, impact
my team. If I do this, please call me out. 
* According to random personality tests I've taken at random company team building events, I am classified as an 
[INFJ personality](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality). 

## Fun facts!
* I like autonomy and ownership. 
* I like to understand what success looks like, so I will know if it’s been achieved. 
* I like to know someone has my back.
* I like to know I am trusted. 
* I need time to process and strategize.
* I have to ask why. A lot.
* I hate how distracted I get.

## Areas I am working on improving:
* making sure I'm continously communicating context and expectations, with clarity
* making sure I'm holding folks accountable for those expectations (including myself)
* making sure I'm sharing regular updates (via Week In Review)
* making sure I'm dedicating time to writing and public speaking
