Our client engaged us to deliver a responsive redesign of their consumer facing website. Their objectives included creating a design system that allowed for future scalability and employing a content strategy to meet newly defined user goals.

Goal: Create a responsive style guide that could scale for future initiatives and deploy a content strategy to meet newly defined user goals.

Role: My role as lead UX included facilitating a discovery workshop with a group of 20 stakeholders, overseeing landscape and best practice research, conducting user interviews, sketching wireframes, building a design prototype and managing a small design team.

Process: I wrote some definition questions early in discovery phase to help frame the problem.

How can we simplify the content management workflow?
How do we tell the story of the firm through content organization?
What elements and components need to be created as a foundation for a design system?


How
Our steps in the process centered on a deep dive into existing content, interviews with several stakeholders and the creation of user personas based on information gained in the client workshop. This was followed by exploration with development teams into technical constraints and considerations for CMS, including recommendations for migration to a new platform. My team produced several content priority sketches to pair with style tiles. These artifacts cycled through a few rounds of iteration as we refined our direction with input from the client. We presented the prototype and our recommendations for a solution roadmap to take into the next phase. Design phase saw us defining the information architecture and working closely with the client on content updates on the new strategy.

Why
The Pattern Library and styleguide were created in order to provide our client with a lightweight, maintainable, future-proof site. This gave them the tools necessary to accomplish their goals.

Solution:
Through design pairing, we built an HTML styleguide with several templates composed of reusable components and modules. Those templates were accompanied by a rules document that detailed data relationships and functional behavior.

Results:
Post-launch, we created a survey to elicit feedback on the site. While the results were overwhelmingly positive, we were also able to measure whether our targeted personas were able to accomplish their goals within the new site structure.
