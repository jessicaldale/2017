title: iOS/Android Pharmaceutical App

Our client, a large medical data provider, was looking to translate their successful, widely used desktop product into a mobile experience. They were eager to launch with both iOS and Android in order to be competitive in the app space, and maintained that the products should have similar look and feel, despite differences in operating system interface guidelines.

Goal: Create a cross-platform app with a consistent user experience and reduce complexity seen in other pharmaceutical products by crafting a well-organized content structure.

Role: My role on this project was Senior UX Designer, which meant I assisted in the discovery workshop, documented requirements, created personas and conducted interviews. I also defined the information architecture, built early sketch prototypes and paired with the Senior UI designer to finalize and diagram the functionality of both iOS and Android apps. Prior to development handoff, we created hi-fidelity prototypes to employ during user testing.

Process: Each time I begin I create a list of questions to help identify the problem.

How can we design a product that follows the respective design guidelines, but maintains consistency in design?
How do we present complex, varying medical diagnosis data in a mobile context?
How will we validate design decisions and meet the expectations of SMEs familiar with current product?

How
The design team was typically three to six months ahead of our development team so we had time to test major features and workflows using interactive prototypes with at least five of our users. Typically, our usability tests were performed in person with a video camera and recorded. In order to observe participants (Retail Pharmacists) and be sure we were on track, we needed to give them tasks to undertake using the prototypes we created. Real-life pharmacy scenarios set the stage for the action and provided an explanation and context for common use cases.

Why
Usability testing was a vital part of the design process because we needed to ensure that the solutions we designed were intuitive and met expectations of users and that the they held up under the prescribed technical constraints.

Solution:  Prototype primary user flows and recommend any critical updates to the designs.

Results: Early testing helped us identify an issue with expected search behavior and allowed us to course correct and design a more suitable solution. We worked closely with the Tech Lead to be sure the database could be re-structured based on our learnings. This prevented us from going down the wrong path during the development phase and saw a reduction of hours and budget spent on bug fixing.
